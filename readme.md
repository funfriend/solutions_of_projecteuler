## Intro

The repo contains my solutions of math problems in [The Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

Corresponding to one question, each folder includes the solutions and a readme file providing some tips about the solution.
Most of the codes are written by ruby.

Any suggestions are welcomed!

## Still Working On!

1. [82 path sum: three ways](http://projecteuler.net/problem=82)

   There is a short solution in the repo. But I just cannot figure out how it works.
   Some help is needed here!
