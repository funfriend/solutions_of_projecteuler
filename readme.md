## Intro

This repo includes some solutions to questions of [The Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) which is an amazing website, and I highly recommend it.

## Some Other Things

*Ruby* is my preferred language when solving problems like this. But Considering that I'm learning *Scala*, I will also write some pieces of *Scala* codes.

## TODO

1. classify these questions.
2. write down the details about how I worked them out.
3. share it with my fellows, and convince them to do *project euler* with me.
