## Solution

Abstract it to a change-making problem.
The number `n` is the money to be changed,
and all prime numbers less than `n` is the coin set.

The key point is to adjust "the coin units set" for a certain number.

## Extra

There is a [Euler transform][1] about [the Prime Partition][2].
But it can be more complicated than change-making.
