## How

To count the numbers between `a/b` and `c/d`,
start from the two fractions and generate mediants until the denominator exceeds the limit.
In a whole, it generates and traverses a binary tree whose deepth is the limited `d`.

The code is rather straightforward, as *the function is recursive*.
