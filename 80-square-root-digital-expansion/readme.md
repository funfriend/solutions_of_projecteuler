The page of [Methods_of_computing_square_roots][1] in Wikipedia
has listed many methods about how to compute square root,
especially, the part of [digit by digit calculation][2].

Another method which also uses big integer is [Square roots by subtraction][3]

I attempted to find a approach which can solve the problem ingeniously,
but after hours' research, I failed.
At last, I use the digit-by-digit calculation mentioned above which comes to BigInteger.

If you guys got a more fantastic method, Please make an issue!
