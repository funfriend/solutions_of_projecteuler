1. For each pow, calculate the biggest possible prime number. We can get: 7069, 367, 83.

2. Then do nested loop and record the result below the upper bound(which is 50_000_000).

That's it!

#### BTW

At first, I want to emit all the result from smallest to largest till to the upper bound.
I have thought about using stack(moving from one triple to another)
and also streams(based on prime pairs in sicp) to generate prime triples.
after trying several times, I failed.

I'd like to see such a solution.
